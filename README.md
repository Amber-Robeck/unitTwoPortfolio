## Description
_In this, my first portfolio you will find:_


-Beautifully written code, that follows ~~all~~ ü§£ _some_ of the industries best practices.

[_] An uncompleted task

 [x] A completed task

In all seriousness though, this is the beginning of what will be a beautiful portfolio page. I just started learning html, css and javascript. I am going to keep adding to this portfolio page (or maybe scrapping it and starting over would be the easier option.) üòÅ However it all plays out in the end there will be one thing that is certain now: this is the beginning of a beautifully-frustrating journey.
